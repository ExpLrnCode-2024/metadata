## Access to code & data {.appendix .unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important}
Where research involves real human lives, there can be a tension between the transparency and reproducibility goals of the researcher, and the obligation to take every reasonable precaution to protect the privacy and security of the people involved.
We sought to strike a balance, by publishing a collection of the most relevant sections of interviews, after making certain to redact potentially identifiable or irrelevant information, but not the interviews in their entirety.
This is in line with the [informed consent form]() signed by all participants prior to their interview, which gives permission to publish _"sections of the interview"_ in _"research outputs and websites"_.
The full interview transcripts will not be made public.
